Collection of Python notebooks for various machine learning, deep learning and analytics use cases

# relataly-public-python-tutorials
Welcome to the GitHub tutorial directory of the relataly.com blog on python machine learning & deep learning!

The files listed in this directory are all Jupyter notebook files.

Each file represents a separate Python project and is described in more detail in a blog post.

Some of the topics covered are:
- Time series forecasting for stock market prediction using recurrent neural networks 
- Computer vision: image classification with convolutional neural networks
- Anomaly detection using random isolation forests
- Explorative analytics and visualization using different charts and tools, incl. heat maps and geographic maps 
- Distributed computing with PySpark 
- OpenAI/ChatGPT/GPT-X, prompt engineering
- Hyperparameter tuning using grid search, random search
- Recommender systems using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering
