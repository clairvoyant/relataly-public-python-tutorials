      "Blackbeard (Pirate): Aye, matey, you may be right about living with nobility, but what use is nobility if one can't afford to keep livin'? The treasure may not be the true purpose of life, but it sure helps in fulfilling it.\n",

      "James (Aristocrat): I agree with you, my good sir. However, I believe that true happiness comes from living a virtuous life and fulfilling one's duties to society and God. Material possessions, though enjoyable, are fleeting and ultimately meaningless.\n",
      "Blackbeard (Pirate): Aye, that may be true, but a pirate's life is all about chasing after riches and fame. By finding this treasure, we can ensure a life of ease and luxury, and that's all that matters to me.\n",
      "James (Aristocrat): I must disagree, for a life only seeking wealth and comfort lacks purpose and meaning. We must strive to fulfill our duty and obligations to society, to leave a positive impact on the world.\n",
      "Blackbeard (Pirate): Aye, ye make a fine point. But methinks one cannot deny the thrill and excitement of finding a treasure that can grant ye all the comfort and power ye need to fulfill those duties and obligations to society.\n"
